    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________SQL databases are relational databases. They store information in tables and those tables are linked to each others using keys (foreign/prinary keys). They are really useful when dealing with related/structured data. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are a more flexible way to store data with no specific format/structure. They are faster at retrieving data in an chronological order. A good use example is the storing of chat messages where you never now how much message you gonna store and the message format. Data can be structured by key-value pair (MongoDB) or key multi-value pair (Amazon RDS). Also they are easier to split in distinct set allowing you to use the power of distributed computation to execute requests on Resilient Distributed Datasets(Big Data like Hadoop/Spark)\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________See answer above with the chat example________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________See answer above explaining the key-value pair data structure________________\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Fault tolerance refers to the ability for a system to continue operating in case of a failure. RDD have the ability to do so by keeping a copy of the data sored on other server in each server of the system. This allows the program to work even if a server or two or ... is down ________________\n",

    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________MapReduce is the ability to split a dataset into multiple sub-datasets (Map) in order to process the data on a smaller scale and then aggregate back the results (Reduce) for the final result. Hadoop is the technology allowing you to do ________________\n",
